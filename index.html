								<h2><a href="https://github.com/FerretScript/ForestForecast">ForestForecast <br />
									- Deforestation Predictor - Hackathon Winner</a></h2>
								<p>I was part of a team that developed ForestForecast, an award-winning web platform designed to predict and visualize areas at high risk of illegal deforestation using satellite imagery and historical data from NASA, alongside Google Earth. This project won GuadaHack, one of Mexico's top hackathons.
								
									Utilizing advanced machine learning models, we achieved an accuracy of 88% in identifying regions susceptible to deforestation. Our platform integrates seamlessly with backend services using Flask and is deployed on AWS, ensuring robust real-time data processing and scalability.
									
									ForestForecast not only highlights at-risk areas but also enhances global conservation efforts by providing accessible, interactive, and insightful data visualization to a wide audience, including environmental agencies and local authorities.
